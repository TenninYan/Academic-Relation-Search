economics of education,"what skills are now rewarded in the workplace?. if the combination of computerization and offshoring is reducing the number of jobs requiring ""rules-based"" thinking. how do we describe the thinking required for the jobs that are left - particularly those jobs that pay good wages?. introduction. defining the educational problem. human capital theory. the basic economic perspective on education. early childhood education. how important?. society or the individual can invest in education at different points in the individual's life. early childhood. grades k-6. on-the-job training and so on. investments at different points in the life cycle may give very different rates of return. these pieces examine the proposition that much of cognitive functioning is well established by the time the child is age four or five with the implication that the rate of return to educational investments in grades k-12 is much lower&mdash.i.e. it is not where we should be putting our greatest efforts. read the feinstein article for general content and its main conclusions and do not spend a lot of time on those statistical parts that you don't understand.. when did earnings become so dependent on education?. if we want to explain market changes over time. a central question is whether the supply side or the demand side of the market is doing most of the changing. imagine you are examining the behavior of the market for middle-aged men whose education stopped with a bachelors' degree. do you expect the supply side of this market to change more quickly than the demand side or vice-versa?. school vouchers and parental choice. do our regression estimates overestimate the impact of education on earnings? the case of ability bias.. think about a regression model that estimates the impact of an additional year of schooling on earnings. we know that on average. students who graduate high school have higher grades. test scores. etc. than students who drop out. similarly. students who go to college typically have higher grades. test scores. etc. than students whose education stops with a high school diploma. question. why might this ""sorting"" cause us to question our regression estimate of the effect on earnings of an additional year of education?. if the return to education is real. does it reflect skills learned or is it a signal?. 11. why has the rate of return to education increased?. midterm. do smaller classes raise achievement?. reducing class size is one of the most discussed ways to raise student achievement. because the reform is simple to explain. it is a good starting point to discuss questions we will face for the rest of the course. exactly how is this reform supposed to raise student achievement? what kind of evidence do we need to know whether this reform works? can we get the evidence from ""natural experiments"" that occur out in the world? alternatively. do we need to conduct controlled experiments that we evaluate? if so. how should the experiment/evaluation be structured?. school accountability. standards and testing. teacher quality and teacher training. policy makers discuss the need do improve teacher quality but unlike smaller class size or standards. it is not very clear how to do it. there are at least four questions we need to answer. what has actually happened to teacher quality over time? what characteristics should we look for when we hire teachers? what characteristics should we look for in deciding whether to give a teacher tenure? and are there things we can do to improve the classroom skills of teachers who are already on the job?. can technology complement what teachers do?. everyone agrees that well-educated students must know how to get information from the web. etc. there is less agreement on whether computer technology can complement teachers in their instructional role. we can think of two broad application areas. computer tutors that help students work on basic reading. writing and mathematics. and simulations that require students to solve complex ""real world"" problems in the classroom. most of our focus in this section will be on drills including a case study of computer-graded essays - how the software was developed and what it can do.. higher education. basic issues and structure. for most policy makers. one u.s. educational goal is a greater number of college graduates. here as in earlier topics. we need to clarify why the current number of college graduates is limited. is it that too few kids are applying? is it that an adequate number are applying but too many drop out? at the same time. before we can think about policy. we need to understand what colleges are trying to do just as we need to understand what firms are trying to do before we can consider the impact of tax policy.. 26. higher education policy. turning to policy. expanded financial aid. remedial instruction and services to encourage students to continue in college are three of the most discussed tools for increasing the number of college graduates. the question is how well each of these tools work?. wrap up.

environmental politics and policy,this introduction to the course reviews the evolution of environmentalism in the u.s. since the colonial era.. general dissatisfaction with big government and the seeming stagnation of environmental policy opens the door for advocates of economic mechanisms to guide environmental policy choices.markets. taxes. subsidies. etc. can be employed to elicit voluntary environmentalism.. we begin with a very basic question. how severe are the environmental problems we are facing?is the earth facing a looming environmental catastrophe? these authors believe we are approaching a planetary crisis.. who are the key players in environmental policymaking? how does the environmental policymaking process work?. the government had to do something about america's unbreathable air. and it did. the clean air act of 1970.congress set air standards. set deadlines. and ordered the air to be cleansed.. this class examines the driving forces behind the rise of environmental legislation that poured out of the congress beginning in 1970s. the legislative surge in american environmentalism--the clean air act and the clean water act in particular--ushered in an era of &quot.command and control&quot. regulation setting the stage for political conflict between private enterprise and the public interest.. the clean water act of 1972 was supposed to make all the waters of the u.s. clean by 1985.what happened and why?. congress. concerned that government environmental agencies might become &quot.captive&quot. of the very industries they were supposed to monitor and regulate. put citizen enforcement provisions in the clean water act. quickly. environmental litigators and the courts became major players in environmental policy.. . this class explores how the reach of a law can expand beyond what its original creators intended.we look at how a series of court cases broadened the jurisdiction of the clean water act and forced the us army corps of engineers to protect wetlands--and then two decades later forced it to &quot.unprotect&quot. them.. the endangered species act (1973) suggests that american policy-makers were prepared to make tough decisions favoring biodiversity over the economy.was this true?and if so. how do we explain it?. we also explore the role of the courts in environmental policy making.. this lecture examines how mass politics extended the environmental mandate. bringing about stringent regulations and standards for hazardous waste control. what mobilizes public participation in environmental policy and how does that participation affect policy? how does the public grapple with complex scientific and technical issues? how do government and media organizations respond to public pressures?. the reagan administration comes to power critical of &quot.big government&quot. in general and government regulation in particular--especially environmental regulation.arguing that environmental regulation was hobbling the economy the administration tried to dismantle the environmental framework that had been established the previous decade. one of its more lasting efforts was to require cost-benefit analysis for environmental regulations.. there can be no doubt that 30 years of environmental policy has lessened the pollution burden on the nation. slowed the loss of ecological communities and species. and improved our quality of life.but not all americans have benefited equally.some americans--minorities and the poor. in particular--may have enjoyed no benefit at all.is this &quot.unfair&quot. distribution of environmental benefits just an artifact of policy or does it reflect racial and class biases in our society?. this lecture explores the rise of anti-environmentalism in the western revolt against federal control of public lands and its spill over to environmental policy in the rest of the country. it investigates relationships among the presidency. congress. federal agencies. and interest groups and how those relationships determine public lands policy.. focus on the collision between public and private interests and values.. risk assessment is an important tool in environmental policymaking.we examine its use in providing safe drinking water. we look at how public information and collaborative/voluntary approaches can reduce environmental risks and improve environmental quality.. this class focuses on suburban &quot.sprawl&quot. and its impacts on landscape. development. habitat fragmentation. etc.. to this point our discussions have looked at environmental policy as conceived and implemented by national and state governments. some argue that the &quot.next wave&quot. of progress in environmental policy will be place-based local environmentalism.. for the past few months we have looked at how institutions. interest groups. elected officials. etc. define and shape solutions to us environmental problems. in this lecture we look briefly at other countries and their experience with acid rain. we consider whether different political institutions result in different outcomes. or if cultural. economic. or demographic factors are more important for explaining differences among national environmental policies.. cheap energy drives the american economy. indeed. it drives the global economy. but cheap energy carries a heavy environmental price tag. extracting fossil fuels despoils the landscape.burning fossil fuelspollutes the air.hydropower devastates river ecology. while nuclear power leaves deadly wastes behind.how do we decide these tradeoffs?. some believe that the earth cannot be saved untill humans recognize that they are a minor player in the natural world. putting the earth first--well ahead of human greed and desire--is the path of deep ecology.can chaining yourself naked to trees or blowing up shopping malls save the earth?. bio-homogenization. alien species. climate change. ,political science,http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/political-science/17-32-environmental-politics-and-policy-spring-2003/,http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/political-science/17-32-environmental-politics-and-policy-spring-2003/17-32f03.jpg,Undergraduate
