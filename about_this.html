      Biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, economics, math, medical science, etc— once being considered separate academic fields, many of them turned out to be more or less interrelated with each other. The word “interdisciplinary research” has gotten more attention than ever before.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em"><b>
      In fact, “interdisciplinary researches” such as computational biology, probabilistic programming and neural network has had  a tremendous impact on scientific world. It is not an exaggeration to say that the most exiting part of scientific research lies in crossing parts of academic subjects.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em"><b>
      In this search system, to capture the essential interconnections among diverse academic field, we are using the technique of natural language processing and data mining, and MIT Open Course Ware as our database. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em"><b>
      Given a academic vocabulary, this search system will find MIT courses that are relevant to it and group them into several clusters in terms of the similarity of their contents. From each cluster, a keyword is extracted which represents the crucial concept shared among the courses in that particular cluster. By using this search system, you may be able to find multifaceted perspectives about the topic you are searching.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em"><b>
      For further extension, we are planning to incorporate Wikipedia, Youtube and scientific papers in our database to make searching more exiting.
